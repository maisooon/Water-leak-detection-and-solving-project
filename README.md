# Water-leak-detection-and-solving-project

the project is about solving the problem of water leak by detecting the leak 
and stopping it, first the circuit will distribute water from tank to another by 
using a solenoid valve to control the water passing through the pipes, then 
by using a water flow sensor we will know the states of the flowing water by 
giving the details of flow rate, then using a water sensor we will detect the 
leak of any water. when the leak is detected a Led and a buzzer will alarm 
about the leaking and the valve will close the water from passing through 
the pipes to prevent any further leaking. In case of no leaking the water will 
be distributed through pipes safely
